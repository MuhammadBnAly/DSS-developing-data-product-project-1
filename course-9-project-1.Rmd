#Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet  
###Muhammad Ali Shaaban  
###17 December 2018  

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.  

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.  

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!  

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
the_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
the_map <- the_map %>% addMarkers(lat= 30.819722, lng= 30.824167, popup="Home")
the_map
```
